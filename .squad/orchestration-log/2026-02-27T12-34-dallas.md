## Task: Set up gh-aw daily-repo-status workflow with Squad agent import

### Outcome
✅ **SUCCESS**

### Work Completed
1. Installed `gh-aw` extension
2. Created `.github/workflows/daily-repo-status.md` with:
   - Engine: `copilot`
   - Squad agent import (`../agents/squad.agent.md`)
3. Compiled to lock YAML (`.github/workflows/daily-repo-status.lock.yml`)
4. Committed and pushed changes
5. Documented import path behavior: must be relative to workflow file location

### Key Learning
Import path resolution in `gh aw compile` is file-relative, not repo-root relative.
